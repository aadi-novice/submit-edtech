## 🔧 Admin Management

### Django Admin Panel (Recommended)
The platform uses Django's built-in admin panel for all administrative tasks. **No frontend admin UI is provided** - all admin operations are managed through Django's powerful admin interface.

**Why Django Admin?**
- **Complete Functionality**: Full CRUD operations for all models with built-in validation
- **Development Speed**: Instant admin interface without custom development time
- **Built-in Security**: Django's robust permission system and CSRF protection
- **Rich Interface**: Advanced filtering, search, bulk operations, and inline editing
- **Professional Grade**: Battle-tested admin interface used by thousands of Django applications

**Admin Features Available:**
- **Course Management**: Create, edit, delete courses with descriptions and metadata
- **Lesson Management**: Add lessons to courses with drag-and-drop ordering
- **PDF Upload & Management**: Upload PDFs directly to lessons with Supabase integration
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts, roles, and permissions with Django's user system
- **Enrollment Management**: View and manage student enrollments with filters and search
- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export data, bulk actions for mass operations
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search and filter across all models with date ranges and relationships

**Accessing Admin Panel:**
1. **For Admin Users**: Navigate to `/admin` in the frontend and click "Open Django Admin Panel"
2. **Direct Access**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/admin/` directly
3. **Mobile Friendly**: Django admin is responsive and works on all devices

**Admin Credentials:**
- **Production**: Create admin via `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- **Demo/Development**: `admin` / `admin123`

- **Frontend Registration**: Students register through the React frontend
